The UK town planning system can be challenging to navigate, with layers of policy and legislation to wade through. Here at Planning Assistance, I distil the important information and provide you with straightforward advice.

Before starting to draw up any proposals for your site you should know the planning constraints and opportunities. This will allow you to understand your choices and confidently brief your architect or design team.

I provide two levels of Planning Advice Reports to suit the varying requirements and budgets of clients, the Basic Planning Facts Report and the Detailed Planning Advice Report.

### Basic Planning Facts Report

#### What is in this report

This report sets out the key planning issues to consider at the start of your project, and includes:

- List of any planning applications previously submitted for the property and their decisions so you can learn from what has been permitted or refused in the past.
- Planning policy designations affecting the site (for example, is your property in a conservation area or another location that would restrict any permitted development rights?).
- Your permitted development rights.

#### Who should get this report?

This report is recommended for someone considering extending or renovating their property as it gives you the basic information you need to understand what you could do to your home without the need for planning permission.

For commercial or other types of sites, this report would be useful to identify the basic planning constraints that affect the site and clarify any permitted development rights the property may benefit from.

#### How much does it cost?

- Prices start from Â£35 for an individual home.
- Prices for other types of site will be provided on request.

### Detailed Planning Advice Report

#### What is in this report"

This report is a planning feasibility study, providing a detailed planning review and guidance on the planning risk associated with a development proposal on your site and includes:

- Review of the location and site context.
- Commentary on the planning history of the site and review of planning applications relating to similar sites within the surrounding area.
- Planning policy designations affecting the site.
- Your permitted development rights if relevant.
- If the type of development sought on the site is known, an analysis of the implications of relevant planning policy.
- Advice on the planning opportunities for the site and next steps for the planning process, including the type of planning application required and documents that would need to be submitted.

#### Who should get this report?

This report is recommended for someone considering a development of new homes or commercial buildings. It would give you the detail you need to understand how you can optimise the development potential of your site.

For homeowners, this report would be useful if your property does not benefit from any permitted development rights or if you are planning a development that is not covered by permitted development.

#### How much does it cost?

This report is tailored to the specific requirements of your site and so please submit an enquiry for a quote.
