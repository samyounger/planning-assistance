Planning policy is generally reviewed and updated every 5 years. At that time the local community and other stakeholders are consulted on any changes to planning policy and given the opportunity to submit comments.

Planning policy will shape the type and location of development across a local authority area, and so consultation on emerging policy represents an important opportunity to get a site allocated for development or influence how planning applications are considered going forward.

If you are interested in submitting comments on a planning document that is under consultation, please contact me to discuss how I can help you shape future planning policy.
