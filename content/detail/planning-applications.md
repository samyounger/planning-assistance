## Planning Application Management Services

### Set up the team

If you don’t have a design team yet I will help you:

- Prepare a Project Brief to get quotes from architects and any other consultants you may need.
- Obtain quotes and help you appoint the right architects and consultants for the job.
- Preparing project management documentation for the design and planning stage if required.

### Preparation of planning application

I will lead the preparation of the planning application by:

- Preparing a programme to establish target dates for submitting the application and obtaining a decision.
- Collaborating with the architects and any other consultants and attending any meetings required (via video communication).
- Communicating with the local planning authority and ensuring all requirements are met in advance of submitting an application.
- Speaking to any other consultees required and preparing any consultation material if necessary.
- Writing up a Planning Report and completing the application forms.
- Preparing any other bespoke reports if appropriate.
- Reviewing plans and documents prepared by the architects and other consultants to prepare them for submission.
- Submitting the planning application.
- Keeping in contact with the local authority planning officer whole the application is being considered and responding to any comments.
- Reviewing the planner’s report, the draft decision notice and draft s106 agreement and negotiate changes as required.
- Making representations to be presented at planning committee.
- Reviewing the decision and advising the client on next steps.

### Track planning conditions and obligations

Some planning permissions require the discharge of planning conditions (listed on the decision notice) and planning obligations (set out in the s106 agreement or other legal document). I can make sure you meet all the post planning permission requirements to remove the risk of enforcement action by providing the following services:

- Setting up a planning conditions and obligations tracker.
- Co-ordinating and preparing relevant documents and submitting the applications to discharge planning conditions or obligations.
- Packaging all application material and decision notices ready to provide to future purchasers or tenants of your development.

## Making changes to a planning permission

If you have an existing planning permission that you wish to make changes to, including changing the design or varying planning conditions, I can:

- Advise you on the type of application you need to submit.
- Provide all services required for the preparation and submission of the application as set out in the “preparation of planning application” section.
