On average, 5 - 15% of applications are refused in England every year. If your planning application has been refused I can help you to appeal the decision.

There is a time limit on when you can submit an appeal, and so you should get in touch with me as soon as possible after receiving your decision notice in order to make the appeal (or in the case of the local authority not providing a decision from the date the Council’s statutory period for deciding the application expired\*). The time limits to appeal are:

- Full planning application: 6 months from receipt of the decision or within 6 months of the date the decision should have been made.
- Householder planning application: 12 weeks from receipt of the decision or within 6 months of the date the decision should have been made.
- Outline planning application:6 months from receipt of the decision or within 6 months of the date the decision should have been made.
- Reserved matters consent application: 6 months from receipt of the decision or within 6 months of the date the decision should have been made.
- Advertisement consent application: 8 weeks from receipt of the decision or the date the decision should have been made.

The statutory period for deciding planning applications is 8 weeks for a minor application or 13 for a major application. If the application requires an Environmental Impact Assessment the determination period is extended to 16 weeks.

## Written Representations Planning Appeal

My process for preparing a written representations appeal is as follows:

- Review the planning application documents, any comments received on the application, the planning officer’s report and the decision notice.
- Prepare a Full Statement of Case to argue why the application should be approved.
- Complete the relevant forms and submit the appeal.
- Analyse documents submitted by the Council and comment as required.
- Review the Planning Inspectors Report and advise the client on next steps.

## Other Types of Planning Appeal

Unfortunately at this time we only provide a service for written representations appeals.
