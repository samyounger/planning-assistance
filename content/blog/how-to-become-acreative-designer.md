It is natural to have concerns when a planning application is submitted next door or in your neighbourhood. The planning system is there to reduce any negative impacts of new development, and the legal requirement to consult on applications aims to make sure the views of anyone affected by a development are considered.

However, comments from the general public often end up dismissed as being “non-material considerations”; this means they are not enforceable under planning policy or legislation. I can help you write your response to planning applications to make sure they are properly considered in the planning process.

It is important to note that **submitting a response to a planning application does not automatically mean that it will be refused**. There is a general support for development across the UK and people don’t tend to submit applications unless they are fairly confident that it will be approved; this is demonstrated by the fact that on average 85% of planning applications submitted are approved. The more likely outcome of submitting a comment is that an application could be updated to reduce the development’s impact on you. This is why it is very important to submit your views.

My approach to preparing comments on applications is customised to the type of application and size of development you wish to comment on. I have a low cost basic service and a more detailed premium service to meet the requirements of any application type. Please submit an enquiry for a quote and details on what I can do for you.
