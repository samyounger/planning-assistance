      #### Consultation

      Consultation is a central part of the planning system, whether it be on submitted planning applications or  new planning policy. However, responses to consultation are often dismissed as its not considered to be a “material consideration” - this means it falls outside of the control of planning policy or legislation. I am able to ensure your views are properly considered in the planning process by translating them into planning speak.

      #### Appeals

      On average, 5 - 15% of applications are refused in England every year. If your application is refused you are entitled to appeal the decision. I have experience working on a variety of planning appeals, but my speciality is written representation planning appeals.

      #### Exceptional Value

      All of my services provide exceptional value. I am able to achieve this by providing a fully remote service. This means that I conduct all site visits virtually using a mix of satellite images, Google Street View, and photos & videos provided by the client.

      #### Do you have a piece of land that could be developed?

      If you have a site that you would like to develop, I can provide you with advice on what you could potentially build. My report will answer the following:

        * Is my site covered by any local planning policy designations (for example conservation area, green belt, etc.?
        * What do the planning designations affecting my property mean for my development?
        * Is my site in an area at risk of flooding?
        * What planning applications have previously been submitted on my site?
        * What planning applications have been submitted in the area and why did or didn’t they get planning permission?
        * What can I do to my site under permitted development?
        * What type of application do I need to submit?
        * What documents do I need to submit to the Council?
        * What is the likelihood that I will get planning permission for my project?

      #### Want to comment on a planning application?

      If you have been made aware of a planning application on a neighbouring property or within your neighbourhood I can help:
        * Understand how the planning application could affect you; and
        * Submit comments on the application to the local authority.

      It is important to note that submitting an **objection to a planning application will not guarantee that it will be refused**. Local authorities are generally supportive of new development and their role is to enable rather than restrict development. The planning system is in place to reduce any impacts of new development on existing properties. A good outcome from submitting a comment on an application will often be that the design is updated in order to remove or reduce any negative impacts on your property.

      Preparing comments on an application can be a time consuming process as it requires a review of the application documents and relevant local policies.  Our quote will be based on the size of the application you wish to comment on.

      We believe that everyone should participate in the planning process and so we offer a basic or premium service to try to meet different budgets.

      #### Do you have a site that you want to develop?

      Did you know that a third of councils can not demonstrate a 5 year housing supply, meaning applications for new housing on undesignated sites should be considered favourably (depending on other constraints). Many councils also welcome new employment generating developments.

      There is no better time to investigate the development potential of your existing site or the one you are looking to purchase.

      I can answer the following questions for you:

        * Is my site covered by any local planning policy designations (for example conservation area, green belt, etc.?
        * How do the planning designations affecting my site affect the development capacity?
        * Can the Council demonstrate a 5 year housing supply?
        * Is my site in an area at risk of flooding?
        * What planning applications have previously been submitted on my site?
        * What planning applications have been submitted in the area and why did or didn’t they get planning permission?
        * What can I do to my site under permitted development?
        * What type of application do I need to submit?
        * What documents do I need to submit to the Council?
        * What is the likelihood that I will get planning permission for my project?
