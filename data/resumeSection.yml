      #### Consultation

      Consultation is a central part of the planning system, whether it be on submitted planning applications or  new planning policy. However, responses to consultation are often dismissed as its not considered to be a “material consideration” - this means it falls outside of the control of planning policy or legislation. I am able to ensure your views are properly considered in the planning process by translating them into planning speak.

      #### Appeals

      On average, 5 - 15% of applications are refused in England every year. If your application is refused you are entitled to appeal the decision. I have experience working on a variety of planning appeals, but my speciality is written representation planning appeals.

      #### Exceptional Value

      All of my services provide exceptional value. I am able to achieve this by providing a fully remote service. This means that I conduct all site visits virtually using a mix of satellite images, Google Street View, and photos & videos provided by the client. In addition, I carry out meetings via telephone and video.
